# HTTP, HTTPS & SOCKS5 Proxy Checker

This is a simple to use Proxy Checker for HTTP/S or SOCKS5. (SOCKS4 support soon)

The usage should be fairly easy, simply put your ip:port proxy list into proxies.txt and select the mode.<br>
Alive HTTP/S proxies will be seperated into "working_http/s.txt" & SOCKS5 into "working_socks5.txt"!
